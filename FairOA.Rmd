## Scholarly articles

- Much is signed over to publishers who charge us to read it.

- Open-access journals have made major headway, but not enough
- Universities are still paying more each year for journal content.

## APC

- In science especially, many journals are funded by APCs - Author Processing Charges.

- Paid for by grant funder, university, or even out-of-pocket.

## Problems with APCs

- Disadvantage poor authors (although many journals have waivers for developing countries)

- Prices can be high; not saving academia much money 

    - Scientific Reports ($1,760) versus Nature Communications ($5,200)

## FairOA - Fair Open Access

- Open access

- No fees

- Governance transparent and by the scholarly community

## The FairOA Principles - fairopenaccess.org

- The journal has a transparent ownership structure, and is controlled by and responsive to the scholarly community.

- Authors of articles in the journal retain copyright.

- All articles are published open access and an explicit open access licence is used.

- Submission and publication is not conditional in any way on the payment of a fee from the author or its employing institution, or on membership of an institution or society.

- Any fees paid on behalf of the journal to publishers are low, transparent, and in proportion to the work carried out.

- acquire resources and financially sustain (Fair) Open Access publications;
- support foundations financially and otherwise in various disciplines (xxxOAâ€™s) that pursue the same goals;
