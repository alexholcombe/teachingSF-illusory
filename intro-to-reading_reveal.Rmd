## Introduction to reading

# Reading is fast

## How quickly are words processed and read? 

This ad from Honda (click to watch) affords an interesting perspective on this.

## The words in the ad

:02 We all got them. That .. :03 that tells you that you've done all you could do.
:04 This is the furthest I can go :04
:05 I will not be able to top that :05
I have given my best :06
But when you force yourself to push :06

<aside class="notes">
When you first learned to read, you sounded out the letters. But now, unless you have severe dyslexia, for many words you recognize them in some other way.
And you manage to put it all together, stringing together rapidly the series of words.</aside>

## Reflecting on the ad, part 1

Viewing the flurry of words that rush by, you may surprise yourself with your ability to read several of the sentences. But do you feel you were aware of every word? I sometimes have the sense that I didn't experience each word as an individual, they went by too fast, but somehow at the end I nevertheless know what all the words are.

Something similar may happen with normal reading. Good readers can read at about 300 words per minute, and the words in the video go at a similar rate. But in normal reading, you may not get the same sense of not experiencing individual words.

Actually the experience may be similar, but the act of asking yourself about the experience gives different results in the Toyota ad case than in the case of normal reading.

## Reflecting on the ad, part 2

In 'normal' reading - reading words on a page - if you ever ask yourself whether you experienced any particular word, your attention will quickly go back to that word and any more fleeting feeling of the word being gone will immediately be replaced by a full experience of the word.  So we never get to linger on fleeting feelings in normal reading. The feeling in normal reading may be so fleeting that we can't even notice it.

## Reflecting on the ad, part 3

You might expect that we could read normal text, like this, faster thanks to seeing and potentially recognizing multiple words simulatneously. 

In fact, most theorists believe that even in normal reading, we only recognize one or at most two words at a time. Our brain can't recognize many words at once, and so from the brain's point of view, normal reading is not very different from reading in this Honda ad.

<aside class="notes">
I went frame-by-frame through several seconds of the beginning video to calculate that some of the sentences are presented at faster than 6 words per second. That's 360 words per minute, not far off normal reading speed. </aside>

# Normal reading is guessing

## What does the demo mean?

References to related actual published research [here](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/)

- Reading probably always involves a lot of guessing, but normally there's no conflict between the guess and reality

- This particular demo only works because the jumbling is done in certain ways. Try those on the next slide

## When jumbling doesn't disrupt reading much

- Transpositions of adjacent letters (e.g. porbelm for problem) are easier to read than more distant transpositions (e.g. pborlem)

- don't change 2 or 3 letter words
